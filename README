PartitionedTable

A partitioned table stores all of its rows into 'buckets'
which are defined by specifying a set of fields to partition on. 
Exact matches on any subset of the partitioned fields can then
be executed quickly using redis' glob capability.

The performance is good when using the 'load' command since it saves
on having to marshal many small objects by bulk marshaling an entire
set of rows at one time. This property makes partitioned tables best
for bulk loading and reading.
